# Predicting Hospital Patient Length of Stay


# In[ ]:





# In[448]:


### Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, hospitals have consistently struggled with patient bed, resource, and staffing shortages, and being able to forecast patient stay length will help hospitals to predict bed/room availability, age-appropriate care, staffing, and resource needs, as well as ensure financial security.

## Issues


# In[450]:


### Issue: Ongoing financial instability is a problem across America's hospital as they recover from the height of the COVID-19 pandemic.


# In[451]:


### Solution: Hospitals will be better able to predict revenue to ensure financial security through patient Length of Stay prediction.


# In[ ]:





# In[452]:


### Issue: Age is a determinant of educational and counseling strategies as well as recovery outcome, and hospitals cannot prepare for this without a forecast of age care needs. 


# In[453]:


### Solution: Hospitals will be better able to forecast needs for age appropriate care through patient Length of Stay prediction.

# In[454]:


### Issue: The nurse shortage in America is only increasing, and miscommunication in staffing needs is a contributor.


# In[455]:


### Solution: Hospitals will be better able to forecast staffing needs through patient Length of Stay prediction.

# In[456]:


### Issue: The COVID-19 pandemic shined a light on how the healthcare system struggles when faced with a lack of patient beds and resources.

## Key Insights and Recommendations:

Insight: Patients who stay for the two most common Stay Lengths of 11-20 and 21-30 Days also have the highest average Admission Deposits
Recommendation: Decrease patient stays of 31+ Days to increase profits

Insight: Regression Analysis revealed that Severity of Illness is the best predictor of how long a patient will need to stay,  but is still considered a low correlation.
Patients identified as Severity of Illness  of Extremely ill at intake were more likely to have a longer stay, and patients identified as Minorly ill at intake were more likely to have a shorter stay.
Recommendation: Although a low correlation, this information can still be used to predict stays for those who are Extremely and Minorly ill. See "Analyst's Next Steps" for further clarification.

Insight:  Type of Admission has the second strongest correlation of 0.18, which is still considered a low correlation.
Patients with the Type of Admission of Urgent were more likely to have stays of 0-20 Days, and patients with Emergency admissions were not likely to have stays 61+ Days. 
Recommendation:  Although a low correlation, this information can still be used to predict stays for those who were Urgent and Emergency Admissions. See "Analyst's Next Steps" for further clarification.

## Key Insights and Next Steps:

Insight: Variables Age Groups and Departments have a very low correlation with Stay Length, although some groups and departments seem to correlate more than others
Analyst's Next Step: The Age Groups and Departments that have low variability could be further analyzed to see if correlations can be identified to refine predictions.

Insight: The two highest correlated variables of Severity of Illness and Type of Admission are still considered low correlation.
Analyst's Next Step: Analyze these variables in conjunction with each other and Stay Length to determine if insights can be gleaned from these three variables together, particularly the less variable categories within the variables.

Insight: An abundance of categorical data and lack of numerical data made statistical analysis difficult, and contributed to the lack of success with this project. 
Analyst's Next Step: More numeric OR categorical (nominal or ordinal) data that can be binary or trinary should be sought out to conduct a more thorough and predictive analysis.
